This is the source code for my "Document Databases and RavenDB" presentation at ISEL. It assumes stable version 888 of RavenDB.

There are several branches, each representing one step in the presentation.

- The s1.* steps are for the introduction and CRUD on a console application
- The s2.* steps show queries on an aggregate root 
- The s3.* steps show another modelling option for the same set of entities

This is sample code to support the presentation and to show different options and occasionally represents different ways of solving the same issue.

The presentation slide deck is also available as a [.pptx](Presentation-final.pptx) and as a [.pdf](Presentation-final.pdf).
